# Twitch-Test  
### Automated UI Testing with Selenium & TestNG

---

## Project Summary
**Twitch-Test** is a Java-based automated UI testing project focused on applying industry-standard testing practices.  
The project emphasizes validating user workflows through repeatable, automated test cases rather than manual testing.

This repository reflects an early, structured effort to understand how automated testing fits into professional software development workflows.

---

## Objectives
- Practice automated UI testing using Selenium WebDriver  
- Organize test suites and execution using TestNG  
- Work within a Maven-based project structure  
- Understand test automation best practices  

---

## Technology Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Java | Core programming language |
| Maven | Dependency and build management |
| Selenium WebDriver | Browser automation |
| TestNG | Test suite execution |

---

## Project Organization
The project follows a standard Maven structure:
- Test source code located under `src/`
- Dependencies and build configuration defined in `pom.xml`
- Test execution managed via `testng.xml`
- Build artifacts generated during execution (excluded from version control)

---

## Running the Tests
Tests are executed using Maven, which integrates with TestNG for test execution and reporting.

---

## Testing Approach
Automated tests simulate real user interactions

Emphasis on repeatable and maintainable test cases

Test execution is decoupled from manual validation

What This Project Demonstrates
Foundational knowledge of automated testing concepts

Experience with Java-based testing frameworks

Understanding of Maven-driven workflows

Exposure to structured test automation practices

---

## Status
This repository is not actively maintained and is preserved as a reference project demonstrating foundational automation testing experience.
